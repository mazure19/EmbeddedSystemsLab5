# EmbeddedSystemsLab5

Working in CSS, the group will become familiar with analog to digital conversions using sensors. 
The first section of the lab will convert one analog signal from a selected sensor into a digital signal. 
The second part of the lab took the ADC of two different sensors. 
For each section, a UML diagram, the level-0 and level-1 block diagrams, and the schematic files for each sensor will be developed. 

The program was based on the out of the box software demo provided by TI. The lightsensor file was translated into register level commands and the main file was trimmed of the programs not in use. Additionally, temperature sensor code was added into main so that both the temp and lightsensor data could be recorded / plotted.
