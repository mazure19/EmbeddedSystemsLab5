# EmbeddedSystemsLab5

Working CSS, the group will become familiar with analog to digital conversions using sensors. 
The first section of the lab will convert one analog signal from a selected sensor into a digital signal. 
The second part of the lab took the ADC of two different sensors. 
For each section, a UML diagram, the level-0 and level-1 block diagrams, and the schematic files for each sensor will be developed. 

The first file will show the code used to obtain the ADC for 1 sensor. The second file includes the code to obtian the ADC for two different types of sensors.
